# lein-gen-src

A Leiningen plugin to generate source files with their corresponding test files (clojure.test). The plugin assumes that you want the generated files in the namespace of the project. There is no provision to re-define the top namespace qualifier. i.e. This is an exercise project more than anything else. 

The plugin is meant to be added to the user profile in ~/.lein/profiles.clj instead of directly in project.clj. But of course, this is matter of taste.

The plugin is not on clojars. If you want to install it localy, you can follow [this] (http://david-demainlalune.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/clojure-private-repositories-and-lein-plugins/) procedure.


## Usage

Once installed the plugin gives access to the "gen-src" task.

running the following command in a project named fun
    $ lein gen-src foo.bar

will generate two files (with minimal ns declarations)

    src/fun/foo/bar.clj
    test/fun/foo/bar_test.clj
